# Canada Air Quality Dashboard - PM2.5 and O3 Levels vs Wildfire Seasons

Welcome to the **Canada Air Quality Dashboard**, a data visualization project focused on analyzing monthly PM2.5 and Oâ‚ƒ levels across Canadian cities, with a particular emphasis on wildfire seasons (Mayâ€“September). This dashboard provides insights into pollutant trends and correlations across locations of various geographic categories, helping users understand air quality dynamics in wildfire-prone and urban areas.
This is an ongoing project, more analysis and data collecting to come!

## Project Overview

This project aggregates air quality data from various Canadian cities, focusing on two key pollutants: PM2.5 (particulate matter) and Oâ‚ƒ (ozone). I explored the data through:
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualizing monthly averages of PM2.5 and Oâ‚ƒ, highlighting wildfire season impacts.
- **Geographic Heatmaps**: Mapping pollutant levels across Canada during wildfire seasons (Mayâ€“September) from 2018 to 2024.
- **Correlation Insights**: Grouping cities based on PM2.5 and Oâ‚ƒ correlations, revealing synergy, alignment, divergence, and opposition patterns.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Select pollutants (PM2.5, Oâ‚ƒ) and location groups to analyze trends.
- **Broken Axis Visualization**: For groups with extreme PM2.5 values, I implemented a broken axis (e.g., 0â€“10 Âµg/mÂ³ and 10â€“75 Âµg/mÂ³ for Pollutant Synergy Zones) to focus on typical values while still showing outliers.
- **Wildfire Season Shading**: Highlighted Mayâ€“September periods to emphasize wildfire impacts.
- **Correlation-Based Grouping**: Cities are grouped into four categories based on PM2.5 and Oâ‚ƒ correlations:
  - **Pollutant Synergy Zones** (e.g., Buffalo Narrows): High correlation, with wildfire-driven PM2.5 spikes (up to 120 Âµg/mÂ³) and Oâ‚ƒ increases.
  - **Moderate Alignment Areas** (e.g., Beaverlodge, Toronto Downtown): Mild positive correlation, with PM2.5 peaks around 50 Âµg/mÂ³.
  - **Mild Divergence Zones** (e.g., Courtenay Elementary): Slight negative correlation, with PM2.5 spikes (up to 60 Âµg/mÂ³) but Oâ‚ƒ decreases.
  - **Pollutant Opposition Zones** (e.g., Bonner Lake, Ottawa Downtown): Strong negative correlation, with PM2.5 peaks (up to 40 Âµg/mÂ³) and Oâ‚ƒ drops due to NOâ‚“ titration.
- **Static Heatmaps**: Pre-generated maps showing PM2.5 and Oâ‚ƒ levels across Canada for each wildfire season.


## Discoveries
- **Wildfire Impact**: Cities in wildfire-prone areas (e.g., Buffalo Narrows, Fort Chipewyan) show significant PM2.5 spikes during Mayâ€“September, often exceeding 50 Âµg/mÂ³, with varying Oâ‚ƒ responses based on local conditions.
- **Urban vs. Rural Dynamics**: Urban areas like Toronto Downtown exhibit smaller PM2.5 increases (~20 Âµg/mÂ³) but steady Oâ‚ƒ levels, influenced by traffic emissions.
- **Pollutant Relationships**:
  - Opposition Zones show PM2.5 spikes paired with Oâ‚ƒ drops, likely due to NOâ‚“ titration from wildfire smoke or urban emissions.
- **Geographic Patterns**: Heatmaps reveal higher PM2.5 concentrations in inland wildfire-prone regions, with coastal areas often showing lower Oâ‚ƒ levels due to humidity.
